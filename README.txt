This is my final project prepared for CPS, LBEF Campus, Maitidevi.

Music n’ Movies Management System is aimed to solve the hassle of organizing the music and movies collection that one has in a complete desktop package. 

It will let you categorize your music according to various genre and other categories. 

Likewise, your movies category will take the shape of your liking assuming you prefer comedy like me. 

It’s a common problem that you lend a movie to someone and you forget about both the person and the movie after certain duration. 

With M3S, you’ll even be able to keep record of such borrowings for your convenience.
